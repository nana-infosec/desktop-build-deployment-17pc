# Desktop Build & Deployment Project (17 PCs)

**Timeline:** Dec 2024 – Jan 2025  
**Tech:** Windows 10/11, Imaging tools (Rufus/ISO), RDP, TeamViewer, Excel

## What I built
- Assembled & configured 17 desktop PCs (hardware → OS).
- Standardized imaging & deployment process for consistent setup.
- Labeled hardware and maintained an asset tracking sheet.

## Why it matters
- Reduced setup time and variance across machines.
- Provided repeatable steps for faster end-user onboarding.

## Artifacts
- `/docs/imaging-checklist.md`
- `/assets/labels-example.png`
- `/docs/asset-tracker-sample.xlsx` (sanitized)

## Lessons Learned
- Always verify BIOS storage mode before imaging.
- Labeling conventions improve troubleshooting speed.
